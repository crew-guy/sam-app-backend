### Custom code in langchain library

In the `chat-verlab-backend/PYTHON_ENV/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain/schema/retriever.py`, I have disabled class inheritance for the `BaseRetriever` class to not include inheriting from `Serializable` class

original code
```
class BaseRetriever(Serializable, ABC):
    """Abstract base class for a Document retrieval system.

    A retrieval system is defined as something that can take string queries and return
        the most 'relevant' Documents from some source.

```

new updated changed code
```
class BaseRetriever(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for a Document retrieval system.

    A retrieval system is defined as something that can take string queries and return
        the most 'relevant' Documents from some source.

```
